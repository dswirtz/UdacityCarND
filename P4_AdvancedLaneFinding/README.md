##Background

Computer vision is the science of gaining a high-level understanding of the world through digital images and videos. It is one of the many important approaches in successfully engineering a self-driving car. The images and videos used for this project were obtained using a front-facing camera on a moving car. The goal of this project is to use various computer vision techniques in a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries on an image of a road. This is followed by an application of the pipeline on a series of images (i.e. video) to assess the robustness of the software.
